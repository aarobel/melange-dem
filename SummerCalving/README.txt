README for SummerCalving subfolder

In this folder are scripts which specify and run a LIGGGHTS simulation for
melange initialized from sea ice-free melange, created using the chanbonds_init.m
MATLAB script. The in.summercalve script specifies a LIGGGHTS simulation with the 
DESign toolbox in which a large calving event occurs and then allows for relaxation.

chanbonds_init.m is a MATLAB script that creates different melange initial conditions
files in a narrowed fjord configuration. Melange length and density can be controlled
and many different possible initial conditions can be created using this script (these
control the characteristics of the melange jamming wave, as described in Peters et al., 
2015 and Robel 2017).
